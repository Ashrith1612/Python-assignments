#Here we will learn to play with variables
# a variable is basically a container for a value
# the container has a name, which is the variable name
# and it has a value of a certain type, such as integer, float, string, boolean etc.



x = 10        #this line of code had declared a variable called x with a value of 10.  x is of type integer

y = 5.25   # here y is a new variable of type float


YourName = "John" # here YourName is a variable of type string

Z = True  #here Z is a boolean variable.  A boolean variable of type string

#How to name a variable?


'''

We can name variables using letters and/ or numbers and/or the underscore character.

No other characters are allowed.  So no space or ? or $ or # or $ or & or ! or@ etc.

The first character cannot be number
The first character has to be a letter or underscore
A variable name cannot be a Python keyword such as print or if or for or and or or

Also, in Python, variable names are case sensitive.  So X and x are considered two different variables.
I can declare both of them in one script.  It is not a good idea to do that.

FirstName = "John"
firstname = "Jack"
first_name = "Nancy"

'''
variables should have meaningful names.
So we use a lot of compound words.
We can separate the compound words using the underscore character
Or we can use camel notation.  In camel notation we can use uppercase for the first letter of each word

Type casting in python
type casting allows you to change the data type from one type to another
integer to float or float to integer or integer to string or string to integer
